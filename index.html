            Though an engineer by trade, my mom always said I was a Renaissance man. I am currently exploring a burgeoning interest in web development, as well as various data-y enterprises, and I'm always eager to learn new things. In my free time I enjoy playing and watching <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/'>soccer</a>, conquering the <a href='http://www.eu4wiki.com/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki'>world</a>, and banging my head against the desk until <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/179123/how-to-modify-existing-unpushed-commits'>Stack Overflow</a> saves me.

            Here is a summary of a few of the things I have done professionally in the past few years (just placeholders until NASA calls me up for Mars colonization, of course):
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Systems Engineer at a DC-area defense contractor with two major focuses: schedule optimization and large-scale military system integration efforts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) for introductory computer science courses, taught in Python. Included work with the <a href='#'>SPARC</a> program, an effort to increase capacity in computer science by changing the way we teach by emphasizing hands-on learning in the classroom. This resulted in all the UTAs giving mini-lectures on a variety of topics each class period, as well as holding office hours and running testing labs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Peer Mentor" (i.e., a tutor) for all for lower-level math and science courses at the university
                </li>
                <li>
                    Soccer referee, lifeguard, church groundskeeper, and general teenage job-haver
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            And last but not least, here are some of my side projects, things that I have been working on just because I find them interesting:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href='https://murmuring-tundra-71478.herokuapp.com'>Decision Tool</a>: A single page application to step the user through performing decision analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Two options exist, an automatic version using pre-populated sample data and a manual version where the user inputs values by hand. Development paused and work migrated to NeighborGood. Written with AngularJS, Express, NodeJS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href='https://intense-basin-65597.herokuapp.com'>Map Guesser</a>: Multiple-choice quiz game. User selects a map title from list of multiple-choice options, is told if they are correct or not, and at the end is given a final score. Still some features not implemented, like restricting and randomizing the guesses per play (rather than using the whole database), adding difficulty levels, and saving/exporting your score. Written with AngularJS, Express, NodeJS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>NeighborGood</b>: An extension of the AHP decision analysis tool, with a specific application towards home and neighborhood selection. Follows the same general principle (AHP decision analysis), but includes a data aggregation tool to parse out publicly available data into a usable format. Currently in development, with the data aggregation tool incomplete, as well as some missing desired features like filters and bounds on criteria. Written with Python, Django.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>DomFall</b>: Just a twinkle in my eye at this point, but I plan to build a game that mimics the everyone-in-the-same-room mechanic present in Spyfall, combined with some Eurogame card and board game design.
                </li>
