            <div>
                Though an engineer by trade, I like to consider myself a Renaissance man. I am currently exploring a burgeoning interest in web development and I'm always eager to learn new things. My aspiration is to be a better software developer than most mathematicians, and better at math than most software developers. In my free time I enjoy playing and watching <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/'>soccer</a>, conquering the <a href='http://www.eu4wiki.com/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki'>world</a>, and banging my head against the desk until <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/179123/how-to-modify-existing-unpushed-commits'>Stack Overflow</a> saves me.

                Here is a summary of a few of the things I have done professionally in the past few years (just placeholders until NASA calls me up for the Mars colonization mission, of course):
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Systems Engineer at a DC-area defense contractor with two major focuses: optimization and system integration. But really I do anything that needs to be done, including munging financial data, writing proposals, or stitching together videos. My work often lies at the intersection of software development and linear programming (mixed integer or not).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) for introductory computer science courses, taught in Python. Included work with the <a href='https://sparc.cs.gmu.edu'>SPARC</a> program, an effort to increase capacity in computer science by changing the way we teach by emphasizing hands-on learning in the classroom. This resulted in all the UTAs giving mini-lectures on a variety of topics each class period, as well as holding office hours and running labs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Peer Mentor" (i.e., tutor) for math and science courses in the School of Engineering
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Soccer referee, lifeguard, church groundskeeper, and general teenage job-haver
                    </li>
                </ul>

                And last but not least, here are some of my side projects, things that I have been working on just because I find them interesting:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href='https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nobleator/bus-opt/blob/master/Arlington%20Bus%20Routes.ipynb'>BetterBus</a>: A project to analyze bus stop locations and routing to improve performance and adoption. Still need to implement performance measurement, timetables, and various other features.
                        <br>
                        Built with Python, Jupyter Notebook.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href='https://better-neighborgood.herokuapp.com'>NeighborGood</a>: An extension of the AHP decision analysis tool, with a specific application towards home and neighborhood selection. Follows the same general principle (AHP decision analysis), but includes a data aggregation tool to parse out publicly available data into a usable format. Currently in development, with the data aggregation tool incomplete, as well as some missing desired features like filters and bounds on criteria.
                        <br>
                        Built with Python, Express, NodeJS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href='http://nobleguy.me/rpv.html'>Race and Property</a>: A data visualization project to examine the relationship between ethnicity and property values. Uses data from the US Census bureau and Redfin and the Mapbox API for display. The initial map is done and viewable, but it is still a work in progress. Plans to migrate to a Jupyter Notebook and add more statistical analysis.
                        <br>
                        Built with Python, Javascript.
