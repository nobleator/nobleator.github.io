                Though an engineer by trade, my mom always said I was a Renaissance man. I am currently exploring a burgeoning interest in web development, as well as various data-y enterprises, and I'm always eager to learn new things. My aspiration is to be a better software developer than most mathematicians, and better at math than most software developers. In my free time I enjoy playing and watching <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/'>soccer</a>, conquering the <a href='http://www.eu4wiki.com/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki'>world</a>, and banging my head against the desk until <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/179123/how-to-modify-existing-unpushed-commits'>Stack Overflow</a> saves me.

                Here is a summary of a few of the things I have done professionally in the past few years (just placeholders until NASA calls me up for the Mars colonization mission, of course):
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Systems Engineer at a DC-area defense contractor with two major focuses: optimization and system integration. But really I do anything that needs to be done, including munging financial data, writing proposals, or stitching together videos. My work often lies at the intersection of software development and linear programming (mixed integer or not).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) for introductory computer science courses, taught in Python. Included work with the <a href='https://sparc.cs.gmu.edu'>SPARC</a> program, an effort to increase capacity in computer science by changing the way we teach by emphasizing hands-on learning in the classroom. This resulted in all the UTAs giving mini-lectures on a variety of topics each class period, as well as holding office hours and running labs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Peer Mentor" (i.e., tutor) for lower-level math and science courses in the School of Engineering
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Soccer referee, lifeguard, church groundskeeper, and general teenage job-haver
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <div class='section'>
            <div class='left'>Profiles</div>

                You can find me online here:

                And last but not least, here are some of my side projects, things that I have been working on just because I find them interesting:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>This site</b>: Everything on this site, including most of the graphics, was designed and created by me. Driven partially by masochism and partially an insatiable need to understand, I learned a lot more about SVGs than I ever really wanted to know.
                        <br>
                        Written with HTML (duh), CSS (more duh), Javascript (most duh), SVG.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href='https://murmuring-tundra-71478.herokuapp.com'>Decision Tool</a>: A single page application to step the user through performing decision analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Two options exist, an automatic version using pre-populated sample data and a manual version where the user inputs values by hand. Development paused and work migrated to NeighborGood.
                        <br>
                        Written with AngularJS, Express, NodeJS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href='https://intense-basin-65597.herokuapp.com'>Map Guesser</a>: Multiple-choice quiz game. User selects a map title from list of multiple-choice options, is told if they are correct or not, and at the end is given a final score. Still some features not implemented, like restricting and randomizing the guesses per play (rather than using the whole database), adding difficulty levels, and saving/exporting your score.
                        <br>
                        Written with AngularJS, Express, NodeJS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>NeighborGood</b>: An extension of the AHP decision analysis tool, with a specific application towards home and neighborhood selection. Follows the same general principle (AHP decision analysis), but includes a data aggregation tool to parse out publicly available data into a usable format. Currently in development, with the data aggregation tool incomplete, as well as some missing desired features like filters and bounds on criteria.
                        <br>
                        Written with Python, Django.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>DomFall</b>: Just a twinkle in my eye at this point, but I plan to build a game that mimics the everyone-in-the-same-room mechanic present in Spyfall, combined with some Eurogame card and board game design.
                    </li>
