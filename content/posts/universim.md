## The Game
Universim is an early access game available on Steam. It is a "god game" where you quite literally play a god guiding your fledgling people (called "nuggets") to grow and expand to cover the entirety of their planet (and eventually space as well).

A core game mechanic is resource management. There is a tech tree that will unlock various buildings that can generate or refine resources, and later buildings will require more and more refined materials.

One thing I found frustrating was the lack of a wiki that concisely documented the various buildings and their construction and consumption/production rates for resources. So I decided to do some experimentation and document my results here.

This is for build {todo} of the early access version of the game on Steam.

Consumption is X per minute? Modified by the number of nuggets working at the building?

| Building | Construction Cost | Consumption | Production |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Steel mill | ??? | 2 iron, 2 gas | 2 steel beams |
| Glass factory | ??? | 1 gas | 3 glass |
| Cement factory | ??? | 1 brick, 1 oil | 2 cement |
| Electronics factory | ??? | 2 iron, 1 gas, 3 oil | 2 electronics |
