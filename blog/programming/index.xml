      <description>Description Undaunted: Stalingrad is a legacy style boardgame within the broader Undaunted series. In many ways, Stalingrad feels like the culmination and refinement of all the ideas included within the first games. You play as a lieutenant in charge of a platoon of soldiers fighting their way through the city of Stalingard in World War II, representing your troops and the fog of war via brilliant deck-builder mechanics.
As this is a legacy game, you and your partner choose a faction, either the Germans or the Soviets, and then you play as that faction for every scenario.</description>

      <description>EML files can be a handy way to create an email message without requiring an actual mail server, as it is simply a file format. You can create these files by hand, but there are some easy mistakes to make. For instances, you need to include newlines in very particular places to successfully generate an EML file.

      <description>Description This is a calculator used to graph probabilities for various attack combinations for the A Song Of Ice and Fire Miniatures Game. This is a tabletop wargame based in G.R.R. Martin&amp;rsquo;s fantasy world where 2-4 (usually just 2) players build armies from different factions then compete to win a certain number of victory points. There are different game modes that determine how to achieve VPs, but generally killing your opponent&amp;rsquo;s troops will help.</description>
