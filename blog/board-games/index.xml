      <description>Description Undaunted: Stalingrad is a legacy style boardgame within the broader Undaunted series. In many ways, Stalingrad feels like the culmination and refinement of all the ideas included within the first games. You play as a lieutenant in charge of a platoon of soldiers fighting their way through the city of Stalingard in World War II, representing your troops and the fog of war via brilliant deck-builder mechanics.
As this is a legacy game, you and your partner choose a faction, either the Germans or the Soviets, and then you play as that faction for every scenario.</description>

      <description>Description This is a calculator used to graph probabilities for various attack combinations for the A Song Of Ice and Fire Miniatures Game. This is a tabletop wargame based in G.R.R. Martin&amp;rsquo;s fantasy world where 2-4 (usually just 2) players build armies from different factions then compete to win a certain number of victory points. There are different game modes that determine how to achieve VPs, but generally killing your opponent&amp;rsquo;s troops will help.</description>

      <description>Engine builders This is a mechanic where each player builds up power over time, creating an engine that feeds itself and allows for more powerful tools to be added over time. The classic example of this is Dominion, where you build your deck by drafting from a shared marketplace of cards to build their individual decks. Another example would be Lords of Waterdeep, where you can build up &amp;ldquo;shops&amp;rdquo; over time which then grant you more resources as other players use them.</description>
