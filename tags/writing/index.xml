      <description>Engine builders This is a mechanic where each player builds up power over time, creating an engine that feeds itself and allows for more powerful tools to be added over time. The classic example of this is Dominion, where you build your deck by drafting from a shared marketplace of cards to build their individual decks. Another example would be Lords of Waterdeep, where you can build up &amp;ldquo;shops&amp;rdquo; over time which then grant you more resources as other players use them.</description>

      <description>The Game Universim is an early access game available on Steam. It is a &amp;ldquo;god game&amp;rdquo; where you quite literally play a god guiding your fledgling people (called &amp;ldquo;nuggets&amp;rdquo;) to grow and expand to cover the entirety of their planet (and eventually space as well).
A core game mechanic is resource management. There is a tech tree that will unlock various buildings that can generate or refine resources, and later buildings will require more and more refined materials.</description>
